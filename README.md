# Platform Events (aka Northern Trail Outfitters Manufacturing)

## About
This app is an adaptation of the Northern Trail Outfitters Manufacturing app by Christophe Coenraets at https://github.com/ccoenraets/northern-trail-manufacturing.  It is the source for the Heroku app companion of https://github.com/dschultz-mo/northern-trail.  My Northern Trail Outfitters app is used as a sample app for a Salesforce Platform Events workshop.  The Manufacturing app runs on Heroku.  It uses OAuth authentication so any number of students can authenticate to it through their Scratch Org and use it to recieve and send Platform Events to the Retail app running in the org.

See the lab exercise workbook at <TBD> to learn more.
